        "<p>One of the longest running socialist experiments in history, Cuba is at a critical crossroads. Cuba\u2019s political and economic spheres have long been subjects of interest and debate, providing fertile ground for exciting academic inquiry. Havana, the capital city, was founded nearly 500 years ago.\u00a0Due to its location it\u00a0became a center of ship-building in the Caribbean and a strategic stopping point in the Spanish colonial empire. Today it is a sprawling metropolis, home to 2 million residents\u00a0and incorporating\u00a0a mix of European, Latin, and American influences. Historic Old Havana\u00a0with its diverse architectural styles\u00a0has been named a UNESCO World Heritage site.</p>",
        "<p>CASA Cuba, the University of Havana, and Casa de Las Am\u00e9ricas have worked together to develop a program of study that will challenge students to achieve a critical understanding of contemporary Cuba, and enable interaction with some of the country's leading academic experts in the social sciences, arts, and humanities. Students will immerse themselves\u00a0in Cuba, taking\u00a0credit-bearing lectures from recognized experts in Spanish on key issues facing the country, and interacting with peers who share an intellectual curiosity about Cuba's past, present, and future.</p>"
