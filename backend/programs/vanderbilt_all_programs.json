Likewise, students for the spring semester are typically able to sit their final exams during the last week of May or first week of June. Please come in during office hours to discuss.\u00a0<br/><br/>The program mainstreams Vanderbilt students and places them in regular university classes with Spaniards. The program is designed for students who not only want the experience of living and studying in Spain, but who also desire the opportunity to take classes in Spanish outside of the traditional Spanish major or minor, including economics, political science, business administration, pedagogy, history, and the sciences.</p>",

Applicants <strong>must </strong>have SPAN 3303 on their transcript in order to receive credit toward the Literature distribution of the Spanish major/minor. Students should be sure to check the external section of their Vanderbilt transcript to verify any transfer or AP credit on their record. Students should consult the <a href=\"https://www.vanderbilt.edu/catalogs/undergraduate/\">Undergraduate Course Catalogue</a> for details and limitations. Contact the GEO advisor or the Director of Undergraduate Studies in Spanish with questions.<br/><br/>Please note that it is student's responsibility to complete and submit visa applications within the appropriate processing timeframe. Visa applications submitted late may not be processed before the start of the program, and may impact students ability to study abroad. Students that choose to submit their Spanish visa applications independently must account for BLS Visa processing times: Once the visa application is received and marked as complete by the BLS office, the period to receive a visa decision is up to 2 months from the day following the registration of the application in the visa system, but this period may be extended if an interview or additional documents.</p>"

          "<p>Singapore, the world\u2019s only island city-state, is one of the cleanest, safest and economically prosperous cities in Asia. Predominantly English speaking, Singapore has four official languages, and offers a blend of cultures with strong influences from its Chinese, Malay, and Indian populations as well as the multitude of other ethnic groups who call this city-state their home. Located 1\u00b0 above the equator, Singapore has a tropical rainforest climate with no distinct seasons. Expect it to be hot and humid all year round. If you are a foodie, then you are in for treat, as eating is a national pastime in Singapore! The Hawkers Centers offer a variety of foods at very affordable prices. Singapore also happens to have the best airport in the world and one of the largest transportation hubs in the region, making Singapore a dynamic gateway to Southeast Asia.<br/><br/>NUS is Asia\u2019s #1 university and NUS Engineering is highly regarded and ranks among the top 10 in the World University Rankings by subject. NUS Engineering, one of the 17 schools at NUS, is almost as large as the entire Vanderbilt undergraduate body. NUS\u2019s main Kent Ridge campus is located on the west side of Singapore, about an hour from downtown on MRT. Given the sizeable campus, students generally will rely on shuttle bus to get around on campus and to the MRT line. At NUS students will find clubs and organizations, a lively arts community complete with new performance and museum facilities, top notch sports and recreation venues, state of the art IT infrastructure and high speed network, an impressive number of on-campus dining options, as well as comprehensive student support services. NUS has rigorous academic programs, strong focus on research and rich learning atmosphere, and appeal mostly to academically serious applicants. \u00a0</p>"
