The program in Mallorca represents an option\u00a0for students seeking to study\u00a0in Spain in a location where there are fewer Americans and which offers the opportunity to take courses in the disciplines offered at the university.Students wishing to study during the fall semester should speak with the GEO advisor during the application process. Final exams at UIB Palma sometimes extend into January, so it is advantageous to plan course selections appropriately. It is probable that students will be able to return to the United States by December 20th, but this will depend upon individual circumstances. Likewise, students for the spring semester are typically able to sit their final exams during the last week of May or first week of June. Please come in during office hours to discuss.The program mainstreams Vanderbilt students and places them in regular university classes with Spaniards. The program is designed for students who not only want the experience of living and studying in Spain, but who also desire the opportunity to take classes in Spanish outside of the traditional Spanish major or minor, including economics, political science, business administration, pedagogy, history, and the sciences.The University of the Balearic Islands provides a faculty member to serve as Resident Director for Vanderbilt students. The Resident Director is responsible for student services, including academic advising and course registration, orientation, excursions, housing arrangements, airport pickup by the host families, and general welfare in Spain. Vanderbilt students have full access to university facilities including computer labs, internet access, and recreational areas.Students wishing to enroll in the University of the Balearic Islands in Palma de Mallorca must have completed SPAN 3303,orfour or more other SPAN courses at the 3000-level.

Contact the GEO advisor or the Director of Undergraduate Studies in Spanish with questions.Please note that it is student's responsibility to complete and submit visa applications within the appropriate processing timeframe. Visa applications submitted late may not be processed before the start of the program, and may impact students ability to study abroad. Students that choose to submit their Spanish visa applications independently must account for BLS Visa processing times: Once the visa application is received and marked as complete by the BLS office, the period to receive a visa decision is up to 2 months from the day following the registration of the application in the visa system, but this period may be extended if an interview or additional documents.AcademicsThe campus of the University of the Balearic Islands is located seven kilometers from the center of Palma. It is a small university by Spanish standards, with a student population of 18,200, and its classes are small. Classes are taught in Catalan and Spanish. All undergraduate university classes in Spanish are open to Vanderbilt students. A list of the undergraduate degree programs at UIB can be foundon their website.Upon arrival in Palma, students complete a month-long intensive language and culture program during the month of September (if studying on abroad for fall semester or an academic year) or February (spring semester), and then enroll in classes at the University of the Balearic Islands. This mandatory four-week, pre-university intensive language and culture course includes language and culture classes as well as excursions to points of interest in and around the city. During the intensive course, faculty advisors orient students to the structure of the university,\u00a0advise and guide them through course registration,\u00a0and acquaint them with university facilities. After the intensive course, students select 3-4 courses in Spanish and take the equivalent of a full Vanderbilt course load each semester.The Vanderbilt program also includes the possibility of a non-credit internship or an independent study if appropriate prior arrangements are made.Vanderbilt Course Evaluation ListUniversity of the Balearic IslandsVanderbilt will use the scale shown here to articulate all grades from the University of the Balearic Islands, regardless of the subject area or language of instruction.University of Balearic IslandsVanderbilt Grade Equivalents9.0-10A8.0-8.99A-7.6-7.99B+7.0-7.59B6.6-6.99B-6.0-6.59C+5.6-5.99C5.0-5.59C-0-4.99FStudent LifePalma de Mallorca is a city rich in history and culture.

This program is a good option for students wishing to study Computer Science, Electrical, Mechanical, Civil, Biomedical, and Computer Engineering, and is best suited for those who are independent, proactive, and self-motivated.LocationHong Kong, officially the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, is a territory located in Southern China in East Asia. It is frequently described as a place where East meets West, reflecting a cultural mix of the territory's Chinese roots with the culture brought to it during British colonization. Hong Kong was officially returned to China in 1997. While densely populated, Hong Kong is also known for its well-managed parks and greenways, and the beautiful Victoria Harbor. Hong Kong touted as one the world\u2019s top culinary capitals, where you may find the cheapest Michelin restaurant in the world. Chinese and English are both official languages.City U is located in Kowloon Tong, an affluent, low density, quiet residential district just minutes away from the happening Mong Kok, Yau Ma Tei, and a short train ride Hong Kong Central. City U is right on the MTR line, and is connected via a pedestrian link to Festival Walk, a seven-story mall with hundreds of shops, restaurants, cinema and ice rink. City U\u2019s premium location affords students easy access to all that the city has to offer, and is considered the most appealing aspect of the City U exchange program by past participants.AcademicsStudents in this programMUST register for 12-18 creditsof courses at City U to stay as a full-time student and maintain visa eligibility. Of this study load,a minimum of 9 credit hours must be registered with departments under College of\u00a0Engineering. Students are advised to have back-up courses in case their first choice class be fully occupied. Academic environment, teaching style, course structure and grading scale at City U is influenced by the British education system, where class sessions are along, lecture-based, and grades are distributed on a bell curve with heavy weight placed on mid-term and finals. Students should be prepared to make learning style adjustment accordingly. Much of the learning in study abroad takes place outside of the classroom. Students should balance academics with community engagement, social/cultural activities, travel, and fully take advantage of what a semester in Hong Kong has to offer.

          "OverviewIn thisEngineering exchangeprogram, students enroll directly at the School of Engineering (SENG) at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), one of Vanderbilt's partner institutions. This program is a good option for students wishing to study Computer Science, Chemical, Electrical, Mechanical, Civil, and Computer Engineering, and is best suited for those who are independent, proactive, and self-motivated.LocationHong Kong, officially the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, is a territory located in Southern China in East Asia. It is frequently described as a place where East meets West, reflecting a cultural mix of the territory's Chinese roots with the culture brought to it during British colonization. Hong Kong was officially returned to China in 1997. While densely populated, Hong Kong is also known for its well-managed parks and greenways, and the beautiful Victoria Harbor. Hong Kong touted as one the world\u2019s top culinary capitals, where you may find the cheapest Michelin restaurant in the world. Chinese and English are both official languages.HKUST\u2019s residential campus occupies a stunning 150-acre site overlooking the Clear Water Bay on the far east of Kowloon Island. This beautiful campus and its surrounding neighborhood will open your eyes to the 75% of Hong Kong that is less known to the world. As the first research university established in Hong Kong, HKUST has achieved top international rankings, especially the School of Engineering. Being a young university, HKUST boasts state-of-the-art facilities, and everything on campus from the outdoor dining patio, library, to the dorm room has a view! HKUST is about an hour and half away from Hong Kong central on public transportation (minibus + metro).AcademicsStudents in this programMUST register for 12-18 creditsof courses at HKUST to stay as a full-time student and maintain visa eligibility. On average, exchange students take five courses per term, adding up to approximately 15 credits. Students can choose a combination of courses across different disciplines to fulfill their academic needs, provided that they fulfill the prerequisites of the respective course(s) and meet all enrolment conditions. Computer Science classes are in high demand, and may be difficult to enroll in. Much of the learning in study abroad takes place outside of the classroom. Students should balance academics with community engagement, social/cultural activities, travel, and fully take advantage of what a semester in Hong Kong has to offer.

Students live with a host family in Kathmandu, as well as participate in a village homestay in the Himalayas, experiencing daily activities of a rural community to better understand the lifestyle of many Nepalis. During their study abroad experience, students also partake in excursions around Nepal, as well as to India. One such excursion includes a trek in the Himalayas, some of the most majestic and beautiful mountains in the world. At the end of the program, students will spend nearly four weeks in an individual pursuit--either original research on a topic of interest, or an internship."

          "In this study center program, students live and learn in Rome, studying at the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies, established in 1965 by representatives of ten American colleges and universities. Rigorous coursework is focused on ancient and classical studies. Students take a minimum of four courses, and a major part of the work is a required comprehensive and integrated course called The Ancient City. The Center, where students live and study, is located just a ten-minute bus ride from downtown Rome, an epicenter of ancient history, art, and culture. This program is forClassical and MediterraneanorArt Historymajors only.Beginning with the fall 2025 application cycle, all students will apply via the new Duke application portal:my.globaled.duke.eduas well as have a Vanderbilt application.The Centro does not follow a rolling admissions process. All applications are reviewed after the application deadlines: October 1 for spring admissions and March 15 for fall admissions. Admissions decisions are typically released within two weeks of the deadline.Duke University does not automatically send transcripts for Centro students at the end of their semester. Students can request that their transcripts be sent to Vanderbilt via theDuke Registrar.Please note:This program typically limits the number of students who participate by institution. Vanderbilt Study Abroad does not determine admissions decisions. As a result, students interested in this program are encouraged to apply early, talk with their Vanderbilt Study Abroad Advisor, and have a backup program selected.VISA NOTICE:A visa is required for this program. This can occasionally require travel to an Italian consulate as well as a visa application fee.\u00a0Students will have support from Vanderbilt Study Abroad and will work with Duke on this process. Students cannot apply for a visa until they have been accepted into the study abroad program.Please note: do not plan international travel while applying for a visa, as your passport will be submitted as part of the application."

You will examine the threat of illiberal democracies on the future of political organizing and evaluate impacts of civic engagement and social movements across different European contexts, where everyday citizens are demanding change.The program is based in Vienna, an influential diplomatic hub at the intersection of Western, Central, and Eastern European political traditions. From this strategic vantage point, you will examine European perspectives on conflict and democracy through a comparative lens: Austria\u2019s distinctive role in international mediation, Hungary\u2019s experience with democratic backsliding, and Serbia\u2019s post-conflict transformation in the Western Balkans.In Vienna and during excursions to Budapest and Belgrade, you will engage with policymakers, academics, and civil society actors to learn about an array of political agendas, local activist movements, and regional identities within the shifting power relations of contemporary Europe. This multi-country approach provides you with a nuanced understanding of how different European regions respond to shared challenges of democracy, security and human rights."
