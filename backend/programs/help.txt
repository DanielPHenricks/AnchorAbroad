<h2>Special Immersive Opportunities</h2>
While internships are not common in Cuba, there are opportunities for <strong>community-based volunteering</strong> and <strong>internships</strong> in a limited number of fields. Students also have the opportunity to undertake a research project focused on the topic of <a href="https://casa.education/research-initiatives">Historical Memory</a>.<p> </p><h2>Student Life</h2><p>The program will provide students with information about cultural and academic events that take place in and around Havana. Topics may include Cuban music, gastronomy, religion, race and ethnicity, sports, and politics.</p><p>Students may engage in extracurricular activities such as community-based volunteer opportunities.

Local dance and music instructors are readily available for students who want to begin or continue their musical education while abroad.</p><h2>Housing</h2><p>Students will share accommodations in a residence provided by Casa de las Américas or administered by Cuban families in a homestay setting. All residences are located in the Vedado district of Havana within walking distance of Casa de las Américas and the University of Havana. Breakfast and dinner will be provided each day. Laundry will be taken care of by each residence.</p><h2>Location</h2><p>One of the longest running socialist experiments in history, Cuba is at a critical crossroads. Cuba’s political and economic spheres have long been subjects of interest and debate, providing fertile ground for exciting academic inquiry. Havana, the capital city, was founded nearly 500 years ago. Due to its location it became a center of ship-building in the Caribbean and a strategic stopping point in the Spanish colonial empire. Today it is a sprawling metropolis, home to 2 million residents and incorporating a mix of European, Latin, and American influences. Historic Old Havana with its diverse architectural styles has been named a UNESCO World Heritage site.</p><p>CASA Cuba, the University of Havana, and Casa de Las Américas have worked together to develop a program of study that will challenge students to achieve a critical understanding of contemporary Cuba, and enable interaction with some of the country's leading academic experts in the social sciences, arts, and humanities. Students will immerse themselves in Cuba, taking credit-bearing lectures from recognized experts in Spanish on key issues facing the country, and interacting with peers who share an intellectual curiosity about Cuba's past, present, and future.</p><div class="s3gt_translate_tooltip_mini_box" id="s3gt_translate_tooltip_mini" is_mini="true" style="background: initial !important; border: initial !important; border-radius: initial !important; border-spacing: initial !important; border-collapse: initial !important; direction: ltr !important; flex-direction: initial !important; font-weight: initial !important; height: initial !important; letter-spacing: initial !important; min-width: initial !important; max-width: initial !important; min-height: initial !important; max-height: initial !important; margin: auto !important; outline: initial !important; padding: initial !important; position: absolute; table-layout: initial !important; text-align: initial !important; text-shadow: initial !important; width: initial !important; word-break: initial !important; word-spacing: initial !important; overflow-wrap: initial !important; box-sizing: initial !important; display: initial !important; color: inherit !important; font-size: 13px !important; font-family: X-LocaleSpecific, sans-serif, Tahoma, Helvetica !important; line-height: 13px !important; vertical-align: top !important; white-space: inherit !important; left: 4px; top: 699px; opacity: 0.85;"><div class="s3gt_translate_tooltip_mini" id="s3gt_translate_tooltip_mini_logo" title="Translate selected text"> </div><div class="s3gt_translate_tooltip_mini" id="s3gt_translate_tooltip_mini_sound" title="Play" title_play="Play" title_stop="Stop"> </div><div class="s3gt_translate_tooltip_mini" id="s3gt_translate_tooltip_mini_copy" title="Copy text to Clipboard"> </div></div><link href="moz-extension://87611992-d256-6e46-a5f6-729941ebdcb1/skin/s3gt_tooltip_mini.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/><style media="print" type="text/css">#s3gt_translate_tooltip_mini { display: none !important; }</style></p>
